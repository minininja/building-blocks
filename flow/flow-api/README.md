### Flow
A flow consists of an expression and an action which is taken should the expression 
evaluate to true.  Flows also implement action which allows for flows to be embedded into other flows.  
Think nested if statements, sort of.

### Expression
An expression is an evaluation of the flow context to determine if the associated 
action should occur or not.

### Action
Definition of some work that will be performed should the action be executed.
